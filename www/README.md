Operational Software for any fablab or makerspace

FabApp was designed as a scaleable system to address the specific needs of the UTA FabLab, but also built as an open source project to address future problems and the needs of makersapces around the world. This system is the underlying software that supports OctoPuppet, a 3D printer manager, and JuiceBox, an access control device for anything that is powered. [Together](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzhfhIHqhlx1ekFxRVc0VTBLRHc) this allows an organization to monitor all equipment, provide equipment access through training requirements, manage inventory, and store completed objects for users.

This is a project in progress and will continue to have additional functionality added over time. Currently, we are under development and on V0.90.  Please stay tuned and in touch as this project reaches maturity for additional information please visit [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzhfhIHqhlx1WldacWF0d3lkYWs) for additional information for both end-users and developers.
